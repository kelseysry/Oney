## About 
[Oney 2.0 Live Link](https://shoponey2.herokuapp.com/)

Since graduating from App Academy, I had time to add additional features to a [group project](https://github.com/ily123/oney) that I worked on. As a group we had a week to build Oney, a clone of Etsy, from scratch. Given more time, I also decided to add a twist on our original group project and give a retro asthetic to the website.   

I added the following additional features: 
- ability to add user's credit card information 
- ability to add user's address information
- edited additional features to shopping cart
    * User can add the same item to the cart and the quantity will increase instead of addding multiple times. 
    * Running total of items in the cart 
- add checkout page 
- changed the overall CSS of the original website 
- add a hidden navigation bar for checkout, selling products, ...etc
